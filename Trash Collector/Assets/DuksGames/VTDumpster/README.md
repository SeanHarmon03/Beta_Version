VTDumpster 
Thanks for downloading Very Tough Dumpster for Unity.

This package includes a model and 4 prefab variations with corresponding materials and textures.

Almost nothing to explain except that the textures are organized by color and their names include hints regarding intended pipeline:
Names including URP are meant for URP > Lit materials.
Names including HDRP are meant for HDRP > List materials.
Some names have both and are meant for both.

Appreciate any feedback!
